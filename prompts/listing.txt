- add an action.yml parameter to output a summary of what was retrieved : name "output-summary": true (default is false) or a string that is a path to a location in the file system of the workflow runner : by default (if only true was set) the location will be ghuzzle-result.json
- there should be a corresponding option in the __main__.py CLI to handle that. Implement in ghuzzle.py with a dedicated function.
- the output will be a JSON file listind the results  in the order of assets listed in the config ghuzzle.json : url of the repo ie gvellut/tppss, description, URL, array of topics (the About section on Giuthub), the actual tag of the release that was downloaded (not just "latest" for string with wildcard), its title, its notes, the file name that was retrieved (for sources as well : if not provided by GH use source.zip or source.tar.gz), the date of the release.
- only output the summary if the ghuzzle process finished successfully : either ignore dep error (so might have some that failed), or if all have been successful. In the former case, if repo information was retrived but asset could not be downloaded / release was not found : return the info that could be retrieved (from the repo or the release). If even the repo could not be read, simply return the repo name as listed in the config. And indicate what step failed : like "repo" :false (for no repo could be read) or "release" : false for no release could be found or "asset" : false if no asset. If I missed a case, add it. Use constants for the output keys (at the top) separate from the other even if same key.

- add an action.yml parameter : name "gen-listing": true (default false). Or a sring  that is a path to a location in the file system of the workflow runner : by default (if only true was set) the location will be the common prefix for the "dest" option in the ghuzzle.json config. If no common prefix (there should usually be : the dist folder but can happen there isn't) : will be the the folder "ghuzzle" in current pwd. for example "dist/apps/app1" and "dist/apps/app2" The value will be "dist/apps". 
- there should be corresponding option in the __main__.py CLI to handle that. Implement in ghuzzle.py with a dedicated function.
- if generation is set : it should output a single index.html file with Javscript (if needed) and CSS inside it (no build step, no separate file). in the code, you can include a separate JS or CSS read in another file so easy to edit in the future. If possible, do not embed the JS or CSS in python source file. For the html : you can use an external file for the base template or preferrably use htpy. Do not use a templating system like jinja.
- If the index.html file already exists at the location set by default or explicitly : there is a log of error but it does not result in the failure of the ghuzzle step. It should not use any framework eith for JS or CSS or HTML. No external font or image.
- Use /favicon.svg for the favicon (does not matter if not there). 
- the listing will take the data that could be output with "output-summary" (if that option is not set, the file itself is not output : just it would use its potential content) and output a simple page : a grid of all the assets downloaded : Title, link to the location (relative to the location of the current index.html), some background color that varies for the items. Some light page cakbround color. Make it look good but light. Kind of a macos launchpad.

- Also add a : gen-listing-config : a path to a local file. No default. Value a JSON file with a dictionnary. Currently only "title" and "homepage"  and homepage-title keys. Define constants in the py file.
- corresponding param in __main__.py
- the title in gen-listing-conf if there is output at the top. The homepage is output the bottom as a link. Do not use English or any lanauge to output default values. Simply do not output them.
- log the location of the output file (so appears in the workflow run).
